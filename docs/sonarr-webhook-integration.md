# Sonarr Webhook Integration

Set up a webhook in Sonarr to notify Aura when an episode file is upgraded. Aura will then automatically redownload the titlecards for upgraded episodes.

---

## Setting Up the Webhook in Sonarr

0. **Generate an API key** in Aura under `Settings` → `Authentication` → `API Key` if you haven't already. Copy it immediately - it's only shown once.
1. **Open Sonarr** and go to `Settings` → `Connect`.
2. Click the **`+`** button to add a new connection.
3. Select **Webhook** from the connection types.
4. Fill in the following details:
    - **Name:**  
      `Webhook - aura` (or any name you prefer)
    - **Notification Triggers:**  
      Check:
        - `On File Import`
        - `On File Upgrade`
        - `On Rename`
    - **Webhook URL:**
        ```
        http://<AURA_HOST>:<AURA_PORT>/api/sonarr/webhook?library=4K%20Series
        ```

        - Replace `<AURA_HOST>` with the hostname or IP address where Aura is running.
        - Replace `<AURA_PORT>` with the backend port number for Aura. By default, this is `8888` unless you have changed it.
        - Replace `4K%20Series` with your library name (URL encode spaces/special characters).
    - **Method:**  
      `POST`
    - **Username:**  
      Anything - this field isn't checked, but Sonarr requires it to be non-empty when a Password is set.
    - **Password:**  
      Your Aura API key from step 0.
    - _(Optional)_ **Tags:**  
      Configure if you want to limit the webhook to specific series tags.

5. Click **Test** to ensure the webhook works.
6. Click **Save** to finalize setup.

> **Note:** If authentication is enabled in Aura, this webhook now requires HTTP Basic Auth (with your API key as the password) - it's no longer accepted unauthenticated. Sonarr's built-in Webhook connection type doesn't support custom headers, which is why Basic Auth (not an `X-Api-Key` header) is used here specifically. The same applies to Radarr's Webhook connection.

## Verifying the Integration

1. **Upgrade an episode file** in Sonarr.
2. **Check Aura logs** to confirm a request was received from Sonarr.
3. **Verify titlecards** for the upgraded episode are redownloaded in the specified library.
    - _Note:_ Aura waits 15 seconds before processing the webhook to ensure Sonarr and your media server have completed file operations and updated file info.
4. If successful, you should see updated titlecards in your library.
